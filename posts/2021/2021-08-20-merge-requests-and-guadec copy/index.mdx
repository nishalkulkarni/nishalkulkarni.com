### Overview
For the past 10 weeks, I have been working on implementing active resource management in GNOME as a part of Google Summer of Code 2021.
On the surface level, this entailed setting up mechanisms to track states of different applications and then making allocation decisions based on this information.
To give a brief idea about my contributions throughout this period I have presented them in the form of tasks along with relevant code and their current status.

### Work Product - Task List

#### Task 1 - Creating a GNOME extension
My first task was to track the active or currently open window in gnome-shell and allocate more CPU weight to it.
After discussing with my mentors I built an extension which on getting notified when the focus-window has changed, gets the PID of the respective window
and then sets a timestamp(inactive-since) as an extended attribute on the cgroup directory for that particular PID.
Resourced daemons can then monitor the cgroup directories for these changes and make allocation decisions accordingly.

Current Status: Complete

#### Task 2 - Updating uresourced
uresourced is the place where most of the changes have taken place, from implementing the basic structure to working with experimental ideas.
Hence I have given a more detailed module-wise breakdown for individual changes. However, you can check out the overall Merge request below.

uresourced Gitlab Merge Request:  [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/benzea/uresourced/-/merge_requests/12](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/benzea/uresourced/-/merge_requests/12)

Current Status: Code review completed, pending merge.

#### Task 2A - App monitoring (r-app-monitor)
This change allows us to recursively monitors changes to the app.slice directory and sub-directories, 
I.e. the cgroups inside app.slice and emits a changed signal whenever the extended attribute on a directory has changed or
when another program calls a function to emit change based on other signals like audio. 
It tracks all information using watch descriptors and app paths, stored in Hash Tables for convenience and fast access.

r-app-monitor code commit: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/benzea/uresourced/-/merge_requests/12/diffs?commit_id=e695d8e2a89171000e2c8981fc83d7aa52e142d3](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/benzea/uresourced/-/merge_requests/12/diffs?commit_id=e695d8e2a89171000e2c8981fc83d7aa52e142d3)

#### Task 2B - Resource allocation policy (r-app-policy)
It is responsible for actually making the policy decisions and setting resources accordingly. 
Hence, allowing for a cleaner separation between tracking and resource allocation.
It acts only when a changed signal is received from r-app-monitor. On receiving a changed signal it calculates the CPUWeight and makes a systemd DBus method call.
Currently, only CPUWeight is adjusted for a particular cgroup and the allocation decision is based on 2 indicators

1. Timestamp - Active window (timestamp = -1) gets a weight of 1000 while non-active window gets default weight of 100.
2. Boosted - If boosted the application gets an additional weight of 500 irrespective of the applications current state (focussed or not)

r-app-policy code commit: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/benzea/uresourced/-/merge_requests/12/diffs?commit_id=e8cce224184af4a44bf6da6dc896dd7139f076cf](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/benzea/uresourced/-/merge_requests/12/diffs?commit_id=e8cce224184af4a44bf6da6dc896dd7139f076cf)

#### Task 2C - Audio monitoring using pipewire (r-pw-monitor)
After having the basic structure in place I started working on using an additional indicator, 
pipewire in this case to allocate more CPU weight to an application currently playing audio and that's why we have the `boosted` flag.
This serves as a heuristic for detecting interactive applications so that they aren't as throttled as non-active applications.

It adds custom pipewire GSource to the main loop and listens to node events from pipewire-pulse API, 
after receiving state change idle or suspended to running we set the boosted flag on RAppinfo for the associated cgroup and emit a changed signal.

#### Task 2C - Boosting games using GameMode (r-game-monitor)
Another area where we can provide additional boost is games.
We use a similar mechanism to boosting applications playing audio,
taking advantage of a background utility called GameMode by Feral Interactive.

Every time a game is registered or unregistered we receive a signal from the dbus interface, 
we then make the app boosted depending on the respective signal.

### Task 3 - Updates to mutter
Having an extension that does the job of setting xattr on cgroup directories is fine for experimentation 
but we want these changes to happen more subtly and that's where mutter comes into play.
Like the PID associated with every MetaWindow we now have a cgroup associated with it.
For now, it's a GFile identifying the cgroup directory for that particular MetaWindow and hence the application.
Whenever there's a focus update detected the code takes care of updating the timestamp xattr on that application's cgroup directory.

Current Status: Code review completed, pending merge.

### Other Tasks and possible Future work
Talking about more places where we can utilize these cgroup features, 
we have currently put up a proposal to implement a way for large applications to manage multiple worker processes using an xdg-portal. 
This will be beneficial in providing better resource distribution and isolating bad actors.

xdg-desktop-portal Issue: [https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/604](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/604)

There are also other ideas for experimentation provided by my mentor like detecting battery draining applications using CPU Pressure information
and collecting hints from .desktop file to make more policy decisions. 
However I could not address these during the stipulated time but thanks to the basic structure now in place,
addressing them should be easy and is something I look forward to doing in the future.

### Events - GUADEC
I gave my very first presentation at this years GUADEC Intern Lightning Talks and the whole event was an amazing experience for me!
Right from getting to know what other interns have been working on, to the positive feedback from people in this community.
I did attend a few other talks and BoFs and was truly fascinated by the work that has been going on.

### Final thoughts
The entire GSoC experience was surreal, 
it has helped me learn a lot about the internals of how various parts of a desktop environment work along with how I can utilise some kernel features.
I feel part of a larger community in GNOME and feel more compelled to contribute to the various projects under it.

None of this would have been possible without the support from my mentors, 
there were a lot of areas that would have been difficult to understand if not for the right guidance from my mentors and I would like to thanks them for it.
